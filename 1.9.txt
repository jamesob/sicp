(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

Using the substitution model, the first + procedure can be visualized as the following:

(+ 2 3)
(inc (+ 1 3))
(inc (inc (3)) ;;  since 1 is dec'd to 0, + returns b

It's apparent that the first + procedure is linearly recursive.

Let's investigate the second given +.

Using the substitution model, we produce:

(+ 2 3)
(+ 1 4)
(+ 0 5)
(5)

It is worth noting that though the second +'s procedure is recursive syntactically, its process is iterative.
