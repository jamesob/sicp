The current implementation of Newton's square root approximation doesn't work so well for very large and very small numbers because of the halting criteria; the procedure stops when the guess squared is within .0001 of the input. For very large number, this becomes too insignificant of a quantity to ever be satisfied, and for very small numbers, this is too easily reachable to yield a useful result.

Watching the change from guess-to-guess is a better approach.
